An implementation of the classic word-guessing game, hangman!

This project randomly generates a word from a large list. Players have a certain amount of guesses to determine the word. Players can save their game as well, in which case it will be serialized and stored.

Ideally, graphical animations and SFX will be included in the finished product.
